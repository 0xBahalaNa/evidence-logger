evidence_logger.py

This script generates timestamped, audit-ready evidence files from policy compliance checks. 

This script:
    1. Loads a policy JSON file.
    2. Checks for overly permissive statements (Action: "*" or Resource: "*".)
    3. Writes findings to a timestamped evidence file to the "evidence" directory for audit purposes.
